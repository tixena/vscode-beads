# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

```bash
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun run compile          # Build extension + webview
bun run compile:quiet    # Build (quiet output - use this to save context)
bun run watch            # Watch mode (extension + webview in parallel)
bun run lint             # Biome check with auto-fix
bun run test             # Jest tests (experimental VM modules)
bun run package          # Create VSIX package
```

## Development Workflow

**Always branch before making changes.** Never commit directly to main. Create a feature branch before any code changes:
```bash
git checkout -b fix/descriptive-name   # or feat/, chore/, etc.
```
Exception: If already on a feature branch and told to continue on it (e.g., multiple beads under one PR).

**Testing workflow with Chrome DevTools MCP**: After building, ask the user to reload code-server and test. Don't automate the reload/test cycle via browser tools - it wastes context.

**code-server for testing**: See `docs/code-server-testing.md` - living document for agent reference. Keep it updated with working config and lessons learned.

**Option 1: Extension Development Host (recommended for debugging)**

1. Open this repo in VS Code
2. Run `bun run watch` in terminal
3. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
4. `Cmd+R` (Mac) / `Ctrl+R` (Win/Linux) to reload after changes

**Option 2: Symlink for local testing**

```bash
# Link extension to VS Code extensions directory
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.vscode/extensions/vscode-beads

# Reload VS Code window: Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
# Unlink when done
rm ~/.vscode/extensions/vscode-beads
```

**Option 3: Install VSIX locally**

```bash
bun run package                              # Creates vscode-beads-0.1.0.vsix
code --install-extension vscode-beads-0.1.0.vsix
```

## Architecture

VS Code extension for managing [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) issues via `bd` CLI.

### Data Flow

1. **BeadsBackend** (`src/backend/BeadsBackend.ts`) - Single source of truth per project. Spawns `bd` CLI commands with `--json` output, parses responses.
2. **BeadsProjectManager** (`src/backend/BeadsProjectManager.ts`) - Discovers `.beads` directories in workspace, manages active project, daemon lifecycle.
3. **View Providers** (`src/views/`) - Extend `BaseViewProvider`, register webview views, handle message passing.
4. **React Webviews** (`src/webview/`) - Single React app with routing by `viewType`. Receives data via `postMessage`, sends actions back to extension.

### Key Patterns

- All Beads operations go through CLI (`bd list --json`, `bd show <id> --json`, etc.) - never access `.beads` files directly
- Status/priority normalization in `src/backend/types.ts` - CLI returns various formats, extension normalizes to internal types
- Webview↔Extension communication via typed messages (`ExtensionToWebviewMessage`, `WebviewToExtensionMessage`)
- Single webview bundle at `dist/webview/main.js` serves all 5 views; view type determines which component renders
- **Prefer components over ad-hoc markup**: Extract reusable UI elements into `src/webview/common/` components (e.g., `StatusBadge`, `FilterChip`) rather than inline spans with class names
- **No native HTML controls**: Don't use native `<select>`, `<input type="checkbox">`, etc. Use custom components (`Dropdown`, `ColoredSelect`) for consistent VS Code-themed styling

### Build System

- esbuild for both extension (Node/CommonJS) and webview (browser/IIFE)
- Extension entry: `src/extension.ts` → `dist/extension.js`
- Webview entry: `src/webview/index.tsx` → `dist/webview/main.js`

## Status/Priority Mapping

CLI status values are normalized: `in-progress`/`active` → `in_progress`, `completed` → `done`, etc.
Priority is 0-4 where 0 = Critical (P0), 4 = None (P4).

## Beads

Use beads MCP tools for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use TodoWrite or markdown TODOs.

**When creating beads**: Add a category label (e.g., `ui`, `backend`, `daemon`, `docs`, `dx`).

**Working on a bead**: When user says "work on", "activate", "look at", or similar for an issue, set it to `in_progress` and assign to `jdillon`. Keep beads `in_progress` until user explicitly closes or requests close.

**NEVER close issues without explicit permission.** Even after user verification, DO NOT close beads until the full workflow is complete: branch created, code committed, pushed, and user explicitly says "close" or "done". User verification that something works is NOT permission to close - that's just testing. Ask "ready to close?" if unsure.

**Updating notes**: Append new information, don't replace existing content. Use `---` separator for dated updates. Only replace if explicitly asked.

**Protected branch workflow**: Issue data commits to `beads-metadata` branch via worktree, not main. Daemon runs with `--auto-commit`. Code PRs stay clean of beads changes.

**Commit format**: Include `Resolves: vsbeads-xxx` or `Related: vsbeads-xxx` in commit messages.
See `bd onboard` for more information.

**Cross-link related beads**: When working on an issue, actively look for related beads and link them with `bd dep add <id> <related-id> --type related`. Examples: follow-up tasks, upstream contributions, discovered work. Don't leave beads orphaned when they're clearly related.

**Hooks maintenance**: After updating `bd`, run `bd hooks install --force` to get latest hook templates.

## CHANGELOG

Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` using [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

- Add entries under `## [Unreleased]` as features/fixes are completed
- Only log notable changes: features, bug fixes, breaking changes
- Skip minor/internal changes (refactors, typos, CI tweaks)
- Keep entries terse - one line per change, with bead reference (e.g., `vsbeads-xxx`)
- Use sections: `### Added`, `### Fixed`, `### Changed`, `### Removed`

At release time, `[Unreleased]` content moves to `## [x.y.z] - date`.

## Code Conventions

- **kebab-case**: Source code, docs, configs (`my-module.ts`, `api-reference.md`)
- **UPPERCASE**: Only for standard files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `LICENSE`)

## Icons

Use [Font Awesome Free](https://fontawesome.com) icons unless there's a good reason not to. Icons are stored as SVG files in `src/webview/icons/` and imported via the `Icon` component or `icons` object. See `src/webview/icons/index.ts` for available icons.

## Upstream Sync

Periodically check [steveyegge/beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for changes that affect this extension:

- **Daemon API**: Check `internal/rpc/protocol.go` and `internal/types/types.go` for new operations, fields, or type changes. Update `BeadsDaemonClient.ts` and `docs/reference/beads-daemon-api.md`.
- **Bead types**: Check for new `issue_type` values (e.g., `merge-request`, `molecule`). Update `BeadType`, `TYPE_LABELS`, `TYPE_COLORS`, `TYPE_SORT_ORDER` in `src/webview/types.ts` and add icons.
- **CLI changes**: Check for new commands or flags that should be exposed in the extension.

Reference repo: `~/ws/reference/beads` - refresh with `git fetch && git pull` before investigating.
